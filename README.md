# Welcome to Sabina's Project Portfolio

Thanks for stopping by! Here you can find some of my academic and personal projects.

## Temperature-Based Fashion Recommendation System 

This project was completed in collaboration with Natasha Vij for our MS in Data Science Capstone Project at The George Washington Univeristy. The goals of this project were to: 

- Compare the accuracy of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification
- Create a temperature-based outfit recommendation system using Spotfify's Annoy (Approx. Nearest Neighbors) Library based on most accurate CNN model results
- Display outfit recommendations on a visual platform

## Aviation Crash Analysis

This project explores trends and commonalities among aviation crashes using unique and meaningful visualizations. The data used for this analysis takes into account civil, commercial, military, and cargo aircrafts.  

Specifically, this project will look into trends in the following categories:

- Aircrafts and operators
- Location and flight routes
- Time of the year/month/day
- Fatalities

## Presence of Diabetes Mellitus (Logistic Regression)

Machine learning project done by Sabina Azim, Arushi Kapoor, and Natasha Vij. The topic for this project was obtained from the annual Women in Data Science Datathon organized on Kaggle. The purpose of this challenge is to “determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus.”

## Military, Healthcare, and Education Expenditure Analysis 

Comparing the military, healthcare, and education expenditure of various nations in the G20. Specifically looking at the total overall spending in each of these departments, as well as in relation to each country's GDP and population over the five year period of 2013-2017. This project utilizes the Google Visualization API, HTML, and CSS.

## Analysis of Snapchat Political Ads Library

Using the Snapchat Political Ads Library which Snapchat has made publicly available in 2018 to look at what political organizations use Snapchat the most for advertising, which ads make the most impressions, targeted age/geographic groups, and what kinds of ads were more prevalent in 2020 around election time.

## World Happiness Report Analysis

Analysis of the happiest and least happiest countries from 2016-2020, what factors weigh heaviest when it comes to calculating the Happiness Score, and if a country's Happiness Ranking has any correlation to their suicide mortality rate.

## Electrical Vehicle Charging Station Analysis 

Introduction to Data Science final group project done by Sabina Azim, Harish Ram, and Kristin Levine. We used various Data Science methodologies and algorithms to make recommendations to someone who is planning to build a new electric vehicle charging station. What insights can we give them to optimize their profit and success?
